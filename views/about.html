            Ayumi Hamasaki (浜崎あゆみ, Hamasaki Ayumi, born October 2, 1978) is a Japanese singer, songwriter, record
            producer, actress, model, spokesperson, and entrepreneur. By 2002, Hamasaki had earned the nickname "Empress
            of J-pop" due to her popularity in Japan and throughout Asia, as well as being referred to as "the voice of
            the lost generation".[1][2][3] Due to her success and relevance throughout her career, she is considered one
            of the top solo female artists of the Heisei era for her influence on the music industry and various fashion
            trends.[4]

            Born and raised in Fukuoka, Fukuoka Prefecture, Hamasaki moved to Tokyo at 14 in 1993 to pursue a career in
            singing and acting. In 1998, Hamasaki released her debut single "Poker Face"[fn 1] and debut major-label
            album A Song for ××. The album debuted at the top of the Oricon charts and remained there for five weeks,
            selling over a million copies.[fn 1] This rapid rise to fame is typically attributed to her insightful style
            of lyric-writing in contrast to her young age; this would continue to be a defining aspect of her work,
            listeners praising her poetic way of conveying relatable subjects.[5] Her next ten albums shipped over a
            million copies in Japan, with her third, Duty, selling nearly three million. A Best, her first compilation
            album, further established her position as a crowning artist with more than four million copies sold in
            Japan.[6][7] It was at this time that she represented more than 40% of her record label's income.[8]

            After A Best, Hamasaki went on to experiment with her music style and lyricism, incorporating English into
            her work from Rainbow onwards. Later albums would range from electronic dream-pop to rock genres, with
            Hamasaki herself saying she does not feel tied to follow music trends, instead focusing on what she enjoys
            and wants to create "whether it is trendy or not".[9] This perspective would continue to resonate with the
            public throughout her career, with her albums consistently placing in the top ten of the Oricon charts to
            present day; she currently holds the record for the most albums to place in the top ten by a female artist
            in Japan, with 54 of her releases reaching that distinction.[10]

            Hamasaki has sold over 50.70 million units in Japan, making her the best-selling Japanese solo artist in
            history.[11] Hamasaki has several domestic record achievements for her singles, such as the most number-one
            hits by a female artist (38); the most consecutive number-one hits by a solo artist (25),[12] and the most
            million-sellers.[13][fn 2] From 1999 to 2010, Hamasaki had at least two singles each year topping the
            charts.[14] Hamasaki is also the first female recording artist to have ten studio albums since her debut to
            top the Oricon, and the first artist to have a number-one album for 13 consecutive years since her
            debut.[15][16] In addition to this, Hamasaki's remix albums Super Eurobeat Presents Ayu-ro Mix and Ayu-mi-x
            II Version Non-Stop Mega Mix, are recognized as two of the best selling remix albums of all time
            worldwide.[17]
